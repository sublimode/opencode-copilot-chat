## What Is This?

**OpenCode for GitHub Copilot Chat** is a VS Code extension that registers models from [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) — both **OpenCode Go** (paid) and **OpenCode Zen** (free) — into **GitHub Copilot Chat** via the official VS Code *Language Model Chat Provider API*.

This lets you pick and use OpenCode models directly from the Copilot Chat model picker, just like selecting GPT-4 or Claude — no extra Copilot Pro/Enterprise subscription required. Simply enter your OpenCode API key.

| Provider | Cost | Example Models |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenCode Go** | Paid (top-up) | DeepSeek V4, Kimi K2.6, MiniMax M2.7, GLM-5.1, MiMo V2.5, Qwen3.7 Max |
| **OpenCode Zen** | Free or paid | DeepSeek V4 Flash Free, GPT 5.5, Claude Opus 4.7, Grok Build, Big Pickle |

## ✨ Features

- **BYOK** — configure OpenCode Go and OpenCode Zen independently with separate API keys, both active at the same time
- **Live model list** — fetches available Go models and Zen models directly from OpenCode on every startup
- **TTL-cached metadata** — merges live `/models` metadata with a 6-hour models.dev snapshot to resolve context window, output limits, image support, and deprecation state
- **Bundled fallback** — keeps the picker usable offline with an internal fallback catalog when live metadata cannot be refreshed yet
- **Tool-calling support** — forwards tool schemas using the request shape each routed model family expects
- **Native transport compatibility** — routes Zen GPT to `/responses`, Zen Gemini to the documented Google-style endpoint, Zen Claude to `/messages`, Go MiniMax and Qwen3.7 Max to `/messages`, and the remaining models to `/chat/completions`
- **Safer requests** — adds sticky routing headers plus request and stream idle timeouts with clearer rate-limit/quota errors in VS Code
- **Diagnostics command** — one-click markdown report showing exactly which models VS Code has registered plus recent request summaries for transport, tokens, latency, and errors
- **Usage status bar** — shows the latest prompt/output/total/cache summary after each OpenCode response
- **Normalized usage markers** — emits a normalized usage data part for each response so future Copilot/BYOK integrations can consume prompt/output/cache metadata directly
- **Experimental context footer hook** — optional opt-in integration that attempts to fill the Copilot Chat footer with real BYOK usage using VS Code internals

## Requirements

- VS Code **1.120.0** or higher with the Language Model Chat Provider API
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** extension — [install from marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) (required — this extension only adds models *into* Copilot Chat)
- Sign in to GitHub Copilot Chat (a personal GitHub account is sufficient — **no** Copilot Pro/Enterprise needed for BYOK)
- An **OpenCode Go API key** for Go models, or an **OpenCode Zen API key** for Zen free models — get one at [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai)

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Install **GitHub Copilot Chat** from the marketplace if you haven't already.
2. Install this extension (or press `F5` in the repo to launch an Extension Development Host).
3. Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** (click the Copilot icon in the sidebar or press `Cmd+Shift+I` / `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
4. Click the **model picker** (current model name) → **Manage Models…**
5. Select **OpenCode Go** or **OpenCode Zen**.
6. Press `Enter` to accept the default **Group Name**.
7. Enter your OpenCode **API Key** when prompted — VS Code stores it securely as a secret.
8. Choose the models you want available.
9. Select any OpenCode model from the picker and start chatting.

> **💡 Tips:**
> - Registered models are automatically available in the Copilot Chat model picker — no extra setup needed.
> - If a model appears in the **Language Models** view but not in the chat picker, hover its row and click the eye icon (👁) to enable visibility.
> - **Go** and **Zen** are separate provider groups, so both can be active at the same time. Switch between them anytime from the model picker.

## Commands

Once installed, OpenCode models appear directly in the **GitHub Copilot Chat model picker** — no special commands needed. The easiest way to manage your API key is via **Settings → Language Models** (gear icon ⚙).

For advanced usage, you can also run these commands via the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `OpenCode Go: Manage Provider` | Manage legacy fallback API key, refresh models, or test connection |
| `OpenCode Go: Set API Key` | Store or update a legacy fallback OpenCode Go API key |
| `OpenCode Go: Diagnostics` | Show a markdown report of registered OpenCode Go models and recent Go request summaries |
| `OpenCode Zen: Diagnostics` | Show a markdown report of registered OpenCode Zen models and recent Zen request summaries |

> **Note:** The native BYOK flow via **Language Models** (gear icon ⚙) is recommended. VS Code will ask for a group name, then the matching API key. Go and Zen are separate provider groups, so both can be active at the same time.

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `opencodego.temperature` | `number` | `0.2` | Sampling temperature for chat completions (`0`–`2`) |
| `opencodego.maxTokens` | `number` | `0` | Max output token override — `0` uses the per-model bundled maximum |
| `opencodego.maxInputTokens` | `number` | `0` | Context window override — `0` uses the per-model bundled context size |
| `opencodego.debugReasoning` | `boolean` | `false` | Write provider `reasoning_content` to **Output → OpenCode** for debugging |
| `opencodego.requestTimeoutSeconds` | `number` | `600` | Total request timeout for OpenCode Go and Zen API calls |
| `opencodego.streamIdleTimeoutSeconds` | `number` | `120` | Cancels a request if the response stream stops sending chunks for too long |
| `opencodego.showUsageStatusBar` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the latest OpenCode usage summary in the VS Code status bar |
| `opencodego.experimentalContextIndicator` | `boolean` | `false` | Experimental attempt to fill the Copilot Chat context indicator with real BYOK token usage |
| `opencodego.freeOnly`      | `boolean` | `true`  | Limit OpenCode Zen to free models only. Disable to include paid Zen models in the picker |

When `opencodego.experimentalContextIndicator` is enabled, the extension installs an internal bridge that maps OpenCode request ids back to VS Code chat request ids and injects normalized prompt/output usage into the Copilot Chat footer. This path is intentionally opt-in because it depends on VS Code internals and can break across updates.

## Models

The extension fetches the live model lists from:

```
https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models   (OpenCode Go — paid)
https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models       (OpenCode Zen — free)
```

The **Go provider** exposes all OpenCode Go models. The **Zen provider** filters the live Zen list to free models (`*-free` plus `big-pickle`) by default. Set `opencodego.freeOnly` to `false` to include the paid Zen catalog in the picker. The bundled fallback catalog mirrors the current Go catalog and both the free and paid Zen catalogs so offline registration stays closer to the live service.

Model limits and capabilities are resolved in this order:

1. Live metadata returned by OpenCode `/models` when available.
2. A 6-hour models.dev snapshot cached in VS Code global state.
3. The bundled fallback catalog shipped with the extension.

Deprecated or known-unavailable models are filtered before registration, so stale Zen entries do not remain visible just because they still appear in `/models`.

VS Code and Copilot read separate input/output metadata fields for UI display. The extension advertises the resolved context window so the **Language Models** table, model picker tooltip, and chat context indicator stay aligned with the latest metadata it can reach.

### Bundled model limits

Limits are taken from the current [models.dev](https://models.dev) registry when available, with bundled fallback values retained for legacy entries that are no longer published there. Per-provider limits are tracked separately (Go vs Zen) so models shared across providers use the correct values for each.

Set `opencodego.maxInputTokens` or `opencodego.maxTokens` to a non-zero value to override the bundled defaults globally.

### Endpoint routing

Most models use the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint:

```
https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/chat/completions   (Go)
https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/chat/completions       (Zen)
```

The extension also routes these families automatically:

- OpenCode Go MiniMax M2 models (`minimax-m2.*`) → `/messages`
- OpenCode Go Qwen3.7 Max (`qwen3.7-max`) → `/messages`
- OpenCode Zen Claude models (`claude-*`) → `/messages`
- OpenCode Zen GPT models (`gpt-*`) → `/responses`
- OpenCode Zen Gemini models (`gemini-*`) → `/models/{model}:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse`

```
https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/messages
https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/messages
https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/responses
https://opencode.ai/zen/v1/models/gemini-3.5-flash:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse
```

Current Go Qwen 3.5 and 3.6 models remain on `/chat/completions`. Go `qwen3.7-max` follows the documented `/messages` route and uses the Anthropic-compatible request shape expected by the OpenCode gateway.
